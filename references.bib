	abstract = {Worldwide growth in electric vehicle use is prompting new installations of private and public electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE). EVSE devices support the electrification of the transportation industry but also represent a linchpin for power systems and transportation infrastructures. Cybersecurity researchers have recently identified several vulnerabilities that exist in EVSE devices, communications to electric vehicles (EVs), and upstream services, such as EVSE vendor cloud services, third party systems, and grid operators. The potential impact of attacks on these systems stretches from localized, relatively minor effects to long-term national disruptions. Fortunately, there is a strong and expanding collection of information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) cybersecurity best practices that may be applied to the EVSE environment to secure this equipment. In this paper, we survey publicly disclosed EVSE vulnerabilities, the impact of EV charger cyberattacks, and proposed security protections for EV charging technologies.},

	abstract = {Power Systems are the backbone of the economic activities and security of modern-day society. Simultaneously the size and complexity of the systems go on increasing at a rapid pace as the requirement for continuous and reliable power supply increases. With the ongoing modernization leading from the large-scale integration of operation and information technologies (OT and IT), power systems are becoming smarter and simultaneously prone to cyberattacks and their frequency of occurrence is on the rise. Malicious cyberattacks on the power system impose huge societal risks. Timely mitigation of these attacks thus becoming a necessity for reliably operating the power system. Load Altering Attacks (LAAs) are an important category of cyberattacks in power systems that tend to increase load abruptly with the motive of damaging the system and causing various losses to the whole society. This work gives a thorough review of load altering attacks, the various types, that can be launched against a power system, and then their mitigation techniques presented in various works of literature.},

	abstract = {The demand for Electric Vehicles (EVs) has been exponentially increasing, and to achieve sustainable growth, the industry dictated rapid development of the supporting infrastructure. This requires building a reliable EV charging ecosystem that serves customer demands while ensuring the security of the Internet-enabled systems and the connected critical infrastructure against possible cyber attacks. To this end, we devise a system lookup and collection approach to obtain a representative sample of widely deployed EV Charging Station Management Systems (EVCSMS). Furthermore, we leverage reverse engineering and penetration testing techniques to perform a first-of-a-kind comprehensive security and vulnerability analysis of the identified EVCSMS and their software/firmware implementations. Indeed, our systematic analysis unveils an array of vulnerabilities, which demonstrate the insecurity of the EVCSMS against remote cyber attacks. Considering the feasibility of such attacks, we discuss attack implications against the EV charging stations (EVCS) and their users. More importantly, we simulate the impact of practical cyber attack scenarios against the power grid, which result in possible service disruption and failure in the grid. Finally, while we recommend mitigation measures, our discoveries raise concerns about the lack of adequate security considerations in the design of the deployed EVCS, which will motivate vendors to take immediate action to patch their developed systems. Indeed, our communication with the concerned parties resulted in positive responses from some vendors such as Schneider Electric, who acknowledged our findings by reserving 12 CVEs, respectively.},

Compared to conventional low-power charging systems, the impact of a cyber-attack might be more detrimental in high-power / fast charging systems since the fault energy levels would be inherently higher both on the grid- and vehicle- side converters. In order to analyze the potential issues that might be a result of cyber-attacks, the negative scenarios are reviewed in this study which include interfering with the grid-side controllers, establishing fake communications between the vehicles and the charging stations, and interfering with the battery management system functionalities. A 100-kW stationary wireless power transfer system with a series-series resonant compensation network is used as a representative system in the analysis. Potential damages and the fault energy levels for selected fault scenarios are investigated. The system is simulated to verify the analysis results. On the basis of the discussed worst-case study, a set of hardware design-level solutions are recommended in this study to provide cyber protection.},

The main drawback in electric vehicle charging, however, is the time consumed to charge a vehicle. The fast charging of electric vehicles solves this problem thus making it a lucrative technology for consumers. However, the fast charging technology is not without its limitations. In this paper we have identified the technology gaps in EV fast charging stations mostly focused on the extremely fast charging topology. It will help pave a path for researchers to direct their effort in a consolidated manner to contribute to the fast charging infrastructure. A thorough review of all aspects and limitations of existing extremely fast charging (XFC) stations have been identified and supporting data are provided. The importance of DC power network based on free fuel energy sources and silicon carbide-based power electronics are proposed to provide ultra-low cost and ultra-high speed XFC stations.},

Electric vehicles (EVs) are taking over the market share of conventional internal combustion engine vehicles. The increasing popularity of EVs results in higher number of charging stations, which have significant effects on the electricity grid. Different charging strat2egies, as well as grid integration methods, are being developed to minimize the adverse effects of EV charging and to strengthen the benefits of EV grid integration. In this paper, a comprehensive review of the current situation of the EV market, standards, charging infrastructure, and the impact of EV charging on the grid is presented. The paper introduces the current EV status, and provides a comprehensive review on important international EV charging and grid interconnection standards. Different infrastructure configurations in terms of control and communication architectures for EV charging are studied and evaluated. The electric power market is studied by considering the participation roles of EV aggregators and individual EV owners, and different optimization and game based algorithms for EV grid integration management are reviewed. The paper specially presents an evaluation on how the future EV development, such as connected vehicles, autonomous driving, and shared mobility, would affect EV grid integration as well as the development of the power grid moves toward future energy Internet and how EVs would affect and benefit the development of the future energy Internet. Finally, the challenges and suggestions for the future development of the EV charging and grid integration infrastructure are evaluated and summarized.},

With the increasing number of deployed EVCS to support the growing global EV fleet, the number of EVCMS are consequently growing, which introduces a new attack surface. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-stage framework, ChargePrint, to discover Internet-connected EVCMS and investigate their security posture. ChargePrint leverages identifiers extracted from a small seed of EVCMS to extend the capabilities of device search engines through iterative fingerprinting and a combination of classification and clustering approaches. Using initial seeds from 1,800 discovered hosts that deployed 9 distinct EVCMS, we identified 27,439 online EVCS instrumented by 44 unique EVCMS. Consequently, our in-depth security analysis highlights the insecurity of the deployed EVCMS by uncovering 120 0day vulnerabilities, which shed light on the feasibility of cyber attacks against the EVCS, its users, and the connected power grid. Finally, while we recommend countermeasures to mitigate future threats, we contribute to the security of the EVCS ecosystem by conducting a Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) effort with system developers/vendors who acknowledged and assigned the discovered vulnerabilities more than 20 CVE-IDs.},

As part of their fight against climate change, governments are diligently working on shifting the traditional transportation system to a greener one, mainly driven by Electric Vehicles (EVs). EVs have become a major component of the global push to combat climate change, owing to their ability to reduce the emissions of the transportation sector especially when coupled with renewable energy resources. To support the exponential rise in EV numbers, EV Charging Stations (EVCSs) are being deployed rapidly by operators and manufacturers alike. As a result, EVCSs have become an indispensable element of the transportation system. This highlights the need for a reliable and secure ecosystem to support the charging needs of EVs and achieve a sustainable transportation sector. Our research group studies the EVCS ecosystem security through examining its different components. The importance of the security of this ecosystem originates from the crucial service it provides and its connection to critical infrastructure such as the power grid. Our work focuses on uncovering the vulnerabilities of the EV ecosystem that can allow attackers to destabilize the power grid as well as developing to secure this ecosystem and Machine/Deep Learning intrusion/attack detection.},

In this article, we present the entities that take part in an OCPP-based smart charging scenario, we identify security issues and threats and present solutions that have been proposed by scholars. We identify open security issues for OCPP and propose future research directions for the security enhancement of the protocol.},

	title = {{EnFuzz}: {Ensemble} {Fuzzing} with {Seed} {Synchronization} among {Diverse} {Fuzzers}},
	abstract = {Fuzzing is widely used for vulnerability detection. There are various kinds of fuzzers with different fuzzing strategies, and most of them perform well on their targets. However, in industrial practice, it is found that the performance of those well-designed fuzzing strategies is challenged by the complexity and diversity of real-world applications. In this paper, we systematically study an ensemble fuzzing approach. First, we deﬁne the diversity of base fuzzers in three heuristics: diversity of coverage information granularity, diversity of input generation strategy and diversity of seed selection and mutation strategy. Based on those heuristics, we choose several of the most recent base fuzzers that are as diverse as possible, and propose a globally asynchronous and locally synchronous (GALS) based seed synchronization mechanism to seamlessly ensemble those base fuzzers and obtain better performance. For evaluation, we implement EnFuzz based on several widely used fuzzers such as QSYM and FairFuzz, and then we test them on LAVA-M and Google’s fuzzing-test-suite, which consists of 24 widely used real-world applications. This experiment indicates that, under the same constraints for resources, these base fuzzers perform differently on different applications, while EnFuzz always outperforms other fuzzers in terms of path coverage, branch coverage and bug discovery. Furthermore, EnFuzz found 60 new vulnerabilities in several well-fuzzed projects such as libpng and libjpeg, and 44 new CVEs were assigned.},

In contrast to other fuzzing targets, network protocol software exhibits its distinct characteristics and challenges, introducing a plethora of research questions that need to be addressed in the design and implementation of network protocol fuzzers. While some research work has evaluated and systematized the knowledge of general fuzzing techniques at a high level, there is a lack of similar analysis and summarization for fuzzing research specific to network protocols. This paper offers a comprehensive exposition of network protocol software’s fuzzing-related features and conducts a systematic review of some representative advancements in network protocol fuzzing since its inception. We summarize state-of-the-art strategies and solutions in various aspects, propose a unified protocol fuzzing process model, and introduce the techniques involved in each stage of the model. At the same time, this paper also summarizes the promising research directions in the landscape of protocol fuzzing to foster exploration within the community for more efficient and intelligent modern network protocol fuzzing techniques.},

	abstract = {In recent years, security test of network protocols based on fuzzing has been attracting more and more attentions. This is very challenging compared with the stateless software fuzzing and most early network protocol fuzzers are of low speed and poor test effect. Since the first greybox and stateful fuzzer named AFLNET was proposed, several new schemes have been designed to improve its performance from different aspects. During the research, a great challenge is how to greatly improve the fuzzing efficiency. Based on the basic analysis in SNPSFuzzer, this paper provides a more thorough analysis about the time consumption in a fuzzing iteration for 13 network protocols and then we design a High-speed Network Protocol Fuzzer named HNPFuzzer. In HNPFuzzer, the test cases and response messages between the client and server are transmitted through the shared memory, guided by a precise synchronizer, rather than the socket interfaces. This greatly shorten the period of an iteration. Moreover, we design a persistent mode attempting to fuzz the service instances in the memory more than one time based on analyzing the side effect information. This mode further improves the speed of fuzzing. Experiment results illustrate that our scheme can improve the fuzzing throughput by about 39.66 times in average and triggers a large number of crashes including 2 new vulnerabilities which cannot discovered by existing fuzzers. Note that, the existing network protocol fuzzing schemes proposed in different directions do not compete with each other and on the contrary, they can collaborate with each other to improve the overall fuzzing effect and efficiency. Consequently, more existing tools can be integrated into our framework to get better network protocol fuzzing effect.},

	abstract = {Summary Fuzzing is an effective approach to detect software vulnerabilities utilizing changeable generated inputs. However, fuzzing the network protocol on the firmware of IoT devices is limited by inefficiency of test case generation, cross-architecture instrumentation, and fault detection. In this article, we propose the Fw-fuzz, a coverage-guided and crossplatform framework for fuzzing network services running in the context of firmware on embedded architectures, which can generate more valuable test cases by introspecting program runtime information and using a genetic algorithm model. Specifically, we propose novel dynamic instrumentation in Fw-fuzz to collect the running state of the firmware program. Then Fw-fuzz adopts a genetic algorithm model to guide the generation of inputs with high code coverage. We fully implement the prototype system of Fw-fuzz and conduct evaluations on network service programs of various architectures in MIPS, ARM, and PPC. By comparing with the protocol fuzzers Boofuzz and Peach in metrics of edge coverage, our prototype system achieves an average growth of 33.7\% and 38.4\%, respectively. We further verify six known vulnerabilities and discover 5 0-day vulnerabilities with the Fw-fuzz, which prove the validity and utility of our framework. The overhead of our system expressed as an additional 5\% of memory growth.},

However, security issues arising from design flaws and implementation vulnerabilities in network protocols pose significant risks to network operations and security. Network protocol fuzzing is an effective technique for discovering and mitigating security flaws in network protocols. It offers unparalleled advantages compared to other security analysis techniques thanks to the minimal requirement for prior knowledge of the target and low deployment complexity. Nevertheless, the randomness in test case generation, uncontrollable test coverage, and unstable testing efficiency introduce challenges in ensuring the controllability of the testing process and results. In order to comprehensively survey the development of network protocol fuzzing techniques and analyze their advantages and existing issues, in this paper, we categorized and summarized the protocol fuzzing and its related techniques based on the generation methods of test cases and testing conditions. Specifically, we overviewed the development trajectory and patterns of these techniques over the past two decades according to chronological order.

The second is Green-Fuzz, which sends input messages in one go and reduces the system-call overhead while fuzzing network protocols. We applied this modification to AFLNet, but it could be applied to any fuzzer for stateful systems. This is the maximum overhead we can avoid, when doing out-process fuzzing on stateful systems.

This nexus of EVs, EVCSs, and power grids creates complex cyber-physical interdependencies that can be maliciously exploited to damage each of these components. This paper describes and analyzes cyber vulnerabilities that arise at this nexus and points to the current and emerging gaps in the security of the EV charging ecosystem. These vulnerabilities must be addressed as the number of EVs continue to grow worldwide and their impact on the power grid becomes more viable. The purpose of this paper is to list and characterize all backdoors that can be exploited to seriously harm either EV and EVCS equipments, or power grid, or both.

	abstract = {We present a novel attack against the Combined Charging System, one of the most widely used DC rapid charging technologies for electric vehicles (EVs). Our attack, Brokenwire, interrupts necessary control communication between the vehicle and charger, causing charging sessions to abort. The attack requires only temporary physical proximity and can be conducted wirelessly from a distance, allowing individual vehicles or entire fleets to be disrupted stealthily and simultaneously. In addition, it can be mounted with off-the-shelf radio hardware and minimal technical knowledge. By exploiting CSMA/CA behavior, only a very weak signal needs to be induced into the victim to disrupt communication - exceeding the effectiveness of broadband noise jamming by three orders of magnitude. The exploited behavior is a required part of the HomePlug Green PHY, DIN 70121 \& ISO 15118 standards and all known implementations exhibit it. We first study the attack in a controlled testbed and then demonstrate it against eight vehicles and 20 chargers in real deployments. We find the attack to be successful in the real world, at ranges up to 47 m, for a power budget of less than 1 W. We further show that the attack can work between the floors of a building (e.g., multi-story parking), through perimeter fences, and from `drive-by' attacks. We present a heuristic model to estimate the number of vehicles that can be attacked simultaneously for a given output power. Brokenwire has immediate implications for a substantial proportion of the around 12 million battery EVs on the roads worldwide - and profound effects on the new wave of electrification for vehicle fleets, both for private enterprise and crucial public services, as well as electric buses, trucks and small ships. As such, we conducted a disclosure to the industry and discussed a range of mitigation techniques that could be deployed to limit the impact.},

The International Organization for Standardization released ISO 15118 standard to specify the communication between electric vehicles and electric vehicle supply equipment. The ISO 15118 standard requires Transport Layer Security function for secure charging communication between electric vehicle and charging station as mandatory. The Transport Layer Security requirements have been completely changed with the latest version of the standard (ISO 15118-20) and have not been clearly described and implemented yet. The implementation of the function causes an inevitable vulnerability due to non-functioning authentication resulting with the entire vehicle function and security system can suddenly stop working. For this reason, new Transport Layer Security protocol must urgently be analyzed, developed, integrated, and implemented. This study proposes solutions for the development, implementation, realization of Transport Layer Security handshake requirements and functions between electric vehicle and charging station with ISO 15118 protocol. The new and existing Transport Layer Security requirements, analyzed, evaluated and the new Transport Layer Security functions derived and fully described. Based on these requirements and functions, a Transport Layer Security communication sequence and processes are developed and implemented and validated on the test bench. The validation proved sufficient implementation of the Transport Layer Security functions (successful authentication, exchange of cipher suite parameters and generation of the TLS master key). The messages were prosperous encrypted and decrypted with the generated master key. Thus, Transport Layer Security handshake is developed, implemented, and validated with this study.},

In this research paper, we will analyze and highlight various vulnerabilities in EVSE systems, including weak authentication mechanisms, and end-to-end communications. We will identify as well potential attack scenarios that can create vulnerabilities that have consequences that range from physical damage to major service disruptions, and identify various solutions and countermeasures to mitigate these vulnerabilities.},

	abstract = {The adoption rate of EVs has witnessed a significant increase in recent years driven by multiple factors, chief among which is the increased flexibility and ease of access to charging infrastructure. To improve user experience and increase system flexibility, mobile applications have been incorporated into the EV charging ecosystem. EV charging mobile applications allow consumers to remotely trigger actions on charging stations and use functionalities such as start/stop charging sessions, pay for usage, and locate charging stations, to name a few. In this article, we study the security posture of the EV charging ecosystem against a new type of remote that exploits vulnerabilities in the EV charging mobile applications as an attack surface. We leverage a combination of static and dynamic analysis techniques to analyze the security of widely used EV charging mobile applications. Our analysis was performed on 31 of the most widely used mobile applications including their interactions with various components such as cloud management systems. The attack scenarios that exploit these vulnerabilities were verified on a real-time co-simulation test bed. Our discoveries indicate the lack of user/vehicle verification and improper authorization for critical functions, which allow adversaries to remotely hijack charging sessions and launch attacks against the connected critical infrastructure. The attacks were demonstrated using the EVCS mobile applications showing the feasibility and the applicability of our attacks. Indeed, we discuss specific remote attack scenarios and their impact on EV users. More importantly, our analysis results demonstrate the feasibility of leveraging existing vulnerabilities across various EV charging mobile applications to perform wide-scale coordinated remote charging/discharging attacks against the connected critical infrastructure (e.g., power grid), with significant economical and operational implications. Finally, we propose countermeasures to secure the infrastructure and impede adversaries from performing reconnaissance and launching remote attacks using compromised accounts.},

The transportation industry, which is largely concentrated in urban areas, emits more than 20\% of total greenhouse gas emissions. Various technological difficulties are confronted and resolved as a result of this focus. Consequently, pursuit and research focusing on the integration of electric vehicles (EVs) powered by renewable energy sources are currently a viable option for combating climate change and advancing energy transition. According to current trends, this type of service will diminish the use of internal combustion engines in the future months. A study of the global market scenario for EVs and their future prospects is conducted. Whether energy storage devices and power electronics converters are properly interfaced determines the efficiency of EVs. Moreover, we provide our thoughts on what to expect in the near future in this domain and even the research areas that are still accessible to both industrial and academics.},

This resulted in a breakthrough in the anticipated number of adopted EVs by the year 2020, and consequently an urge for an available and trustworthy EV charging infrastructure. The diversity of the involved players, the used technologies, the bulk data exchange, and the widespread nature of the charging network give rise to security concerns in the form of message tampering, spoofing, or delaying among others to disconcert the charging service along with the underlying power layer. Furthermore, confidentiality and privacy of user information (i.e. identity, location, payment information, etc.) is another major concern associated with the deployment and use of the charging infrastructure. Thus, there is a need to identify and classify such concerns, and devise suitable solutions for a secure charging infrastructure. In this paper, we present a security assessment of the EV charging infrastructure. We highlight and categorize cyber threats targeting different players in a charging system, along with the security solutions presented in the literature. Finally, we present a gap analysis and insights into future research directions for EV charging system security.},

	abstract = {The electric vehicle charging infrastructure supports Plug-in Electric Vehicle (PEV) refueling through vehicle charging equipment (EVSE). Communication and control methods are being developed and tested to respond to growing PEV electrical load and enable this new grid load to expand renewable resource integration and grid services, without additional electrical distribution system capacity and investment. The new communication and control method increases the potential for cyberattacks or malware to pass through the electric vehicle charging infrastructure. The infrastructure-comprising EVs, EVSEs, building automation and energy management systems, and electric power grid-can be adversely impacted, negatively affecting safety, reliability and efficacy objectives.In this work, we describe principles of Vehicle Charging Infrastructure Security (VCIS) that addresses critical gaps in the present security paradigm, while retaining privacy and autonomy of stakeholders. The VCIS principles we enumerate are: isolate network communications, implement advanced, continuous monitoring by "trusted" entities, verify compatibility of physical measurements and cyber state, and incorporate processes to respond and recover to cyberattacks commensurate with the threat. We further foresee that information sharing and coordination between car manufacturers, EVSE vendors, facilities, and electric utilities is essential for VCIS success.},

In this paper, the crosstalk shielded cable model is established for the signal line affected by the electromagnetic interference of the power line, based on the actual electrical parameters of cables. The purpose of this paper is to solve the transfer impedance of the shielded cable and calculate the characteristics of crosstalk by the Finite Difference-Time Domain method (FDTD). Finally, the variation rules of terminal matching load, terminal direct grounding and crosstalk under different layouts are studied. The results have certain reference value for perfecting the theory of monitoring and communication in rectangular tunnel and exerting the safety guarantee function of power safety monitoring equipment.},

It’s a common phenomenon observed in power lines, communication lines and electrified railway lines. In this paper we investigate the crosstalk in multi-conductor transmission lines (MTLs) above finitely conducting ground as a function of ground conductivity, height of the receptor conductor, position of emitter source and the terminal loads. It is shown that ground conductivity has a significant influence in the amplitude and wave shape of the crosstalk currents in MTLs, which has not received sufficient attention earlier. In general finite ground conductivity increases the crosstalk current magnitudes in the receptor circuit loads both at the near end and far end. There are situations in which far end crosstalk is larger than the near end crosstalk for identical loads at both ends. These observations have important implications in electromagnetic interference studies of outdoor systems such as railway signaling systems subjected to lightning strikes.},

This crosstalk reduction technique uses the pseudomatched impedances’ method that determines the characteristic parameters of the chosen line through the transmission lines’ theory. Besides, we establish the telegrapher's equations to determine the characteristic impedances of the line. Further, two types of lines are employed here to apply the pseudo-matched impedances’ method. The far-and near-ends crosstalk are measured with two strategies known as Simulink diagram and Matlab code. The Simulink diagram of the power line provides crosstalk curves and the Matlab code directly returns crosstalk values. It appears that the crosstalk has a reduction rate between 20 and 50\% compared to previous investigations using pseudomatched impedances in literature. Moreover, the variation of two different types of impedances leads to a crosstalk reduction rate that approaches 99\%.},

	abstract = {The charging process is central to the everyday usability of an electric car. The shorter the stop required for charging the higher the customer’s satisfaction. Drivers of a fully electric Audi model thus benefit from high charging speeds because the charging capacity of up to 150 kW is available for a large portion of the charging procedure. This enables sophisticated thermal management of the lithium-ion battery. In order to assess the everyday usability of an electric car, customers should take not just the nominal maximum charging capacity but also the charging speed into account.},
