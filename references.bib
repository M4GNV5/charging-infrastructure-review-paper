	abstract = {Worldwide growth in electric vehicle use is prompting new installations of private and public electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE). EVSE devices support the electrification of the transportation industry but also represent a linchpin for power systems and transportation infrastructures. Cybersecurity researchers have recently identified several vulnerabilities that exist in EVSE devices, communications to electric vehicles (EVs), and upstream services, such as EVSE vendor cloud services, third party systems, and grid operators. The potential impact of attacks on these systems stretches from localized, relatively minor effects to long-term national disruptions. Fortunately, there is a strong and expanding collection of information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) cybersecurity best practices that may be applied to the EVSE environment to secure this equipment. In this paper, we survey publicly disclosed EVSE vulnerabilities, the impact of EV charger cyberattacks, and proposed security protections for EV charging technologies.},

Simultaneously the size and complexity of the systems go on increasing at a rapid pace as the requirement for continuous and reliable power supply increases. With the ongoing modernization leading from the large-scale integration of operation and information technologies (OT and IT), power systems are becoming smarter and simultaneously prone to cyberattacks and their frequency of occurrence is on the rise. Malicious cyberattacks on the power system impose huge societal risks. Timely mitigation of these attacks thus becoming a necessity for reliably operating the power system. Load Altering Attacks (LAAs) are an important category of cyberattacks in power systems that tend to increase load abruptly with the motive of damaging the system and causing various losses to the whole society. This work gives a thorough review of load altering attacks, the various types, that can be launched against a power system, and then their mitigation techniques presented in various works of literature.},

This requires building a reliable EV charging ecosystem that serves customer demands while ensuring the security of the Internet-enabled systems and the connected critical infrastructure against possible cyber attacks. To this end, we devise a system lookup and collection approach to obtain a representative sample of widely deployed EV Charging Station Management Systems (EVCSMS). Furthermore, we leverage reverse engineering and penetration testing techniques to perform a first-of-a-kind comprehensive security and vulnerability analysis of the identified EVCSMS and their software/firmware implementations. Indeed, our systematic analysis unveils an array of vulnerabilities, which demonstrate the insecurity of the EVCSMS against remote cyber attacks. Considering the feasibility of such attacks, we discuss attack implications against the EV charging stations (EVCS) and their users. More importantly, we simulate the impact of practical cyber attack scenarios against the power grid, which result in possible service disruption and failure in the grid. Finally, while we recommend mitigation measures, our discoveries raise concerns about the lack of adequate security considerations in the design of the deployed EVCS, which will motivate vendors to take immediate action to patch their developed systems. Indeed, our communication with the concerned parties resulted in positive responses from some vendors such as Schneider Electric, who acknowledged our findings by reserving 12 CVEs, respectively.},

Compared to conventional low-power charging systems, the impact of a cyber-attack might be more detrimental in high-power / fast charging systems since the fault energy levels would be inherently higher both on the grid- and vehicle- side converters. In order to analyze the potential issues that might be a result of cyber-attacks, the negative scenarios are reviewed in this study which include interfering with the grid-side controllers, establishing fake communications between the vehicles and the charging stations, and interfering with the battery management system functionalities. A 100-kW stationary wireless power transfer system with a series-series resonant compensation network is used as a representative system in the analysis. Potential damages and the fault energy levels for selected fault scenarios are investigated. The system is simulated to verify the analysis results. On the basis of the discussed worst-case study, a set of hardware design-level solutions are recommended in this study to provide cyber protection.},

The fast charging of electric vehicles solves this problem thus making it a lucrative technology for consumers. However, the fast charging technology is not without its limitations. In this paper we have identified the technology gaps in EV fast charging stations mostly focused on the extremely fast charging topology. It will help pave a path for researchers to direct their effort in a consolidated manner to contribute to the fast charging infrastructure. A thorough review of all aspects and limitations of existing extremely fast charging (XFC) stations have been identified and supporting data are provided.

In this paper, a comprehensive review of the current situation of the EV market, standards, charging infrastructure, and the impact of EV charging on the grid is presented. The paper introduces the current EV status, and provides a comprehensive review on important international EV charging and grid interconnection standards. Different infrastructure configurations in terms of control and communication architectures for EV charging are studied and evaluated. The electric power market is studied by considering the participation roles of EV aggregators and individual EV owners, and different optimization and game based algorithms for EV grid integration management are reviewed.

With the increasing number of deployed EVCS to support the growing global EV fleet, the number of EVCMS are consequently growing, which introduces a new attack surface. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-stage framework, ChargePrint, to discover Internet-connected EVCMS and investigate their security posture. ChargePrint leverages identifiers extracted from a small seed of EVCMS to extend the capabilities of device search engines through iterative fingerprinting and a combination of classification and clustering approaches. Using initial seeds from 1,800 discovered hosts that deployed 9 distinct EVCMS, we identified 27,439 online EVCS instrumented by 44 unique EVCMS. Consequently, our in-depth security analysis highlights the insecurity of the deployed EVCMS by uncovering 120 0day vulnerabilities, which shed light on the feasibility of cyber attacks against the EVCS, its users, and the connected power grid. Finally, while we recommend countermeasures to mitigate future threats, we contribute to the security of the EVCS ecosystem by conducting a Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) effort with system developers/vendors who acknowledged and assigned the discovered vulnerabilities more than 20 CVE-IDs.},

As part of their fight against climate change, governments are diligently working on shifting the traditional transportation system to a greener one, mainly driven by Electric Vehicles (EVs). EVs have become a major component of the global push to combat climate change, owing to their ability to reduce the emissions of the transportation sector especially when coupled with renewable energy resources. To support the exponential rise in EV numbers, EV Charging Stations (EVCSs) are being deployed rapidly by operators and manufacturers alike. As a result, EVCSs have become an indispensable element of the transportation system. This highlights the need for a reliable and secure ecosystem to support the charging needs of EVs and achieve a sustainable transportation sector. Our research group studies the EVCS ecosystem security through examining its different components. The importance of the security of this ecosystem originates from the crucial service it provides and its connection to critical infrastructure such as the power grid. Our work focuses on uncovering the vulnerabilities of the EV ecosystem that can allow attackers to destabilize the power grid as well as developing to secure this ecosystem and Machine/Deep Learning intrusion/attack detection.},

	abstract = {The electric vehicle (EV) charging system plays a significant role in the future of energy systems. The widespread adoption of operating EV charging is accelerates the integration of transmission and distribution systems, this helps to accommodate a clean atmosphere and drop conventional fuel dependence. An EV interacts with different objects while recharging in the charging station. The charging stations that power up such vehicles can also be connected to the internet and make them particularly to malicious attack through hacking or remote accessing. Thus, this technology has caught the attention of many researchers who have proposed authentication protocols to provide a secure connection for exchanging information between electric vehicles and the charging station. This article discusses comprehensive security threats in the EV charging systems. Moreover, it reviews the architecture of the charging station system and the protocols between electric vehicles and charging stations.},

The number of EV charging sites has considerably increased in residential as well as in public areas. Within these EV charging sites, various entities need to communicate in a secure and efï¬cient way. The Open Charge Point Protocol (OCPP) offers a way to coordinate this communication and is already being used in many implementations. However, only the latest OCPP 2.0 version of the protocol includes certain security features. In this article, we present the entities that take part in an OCPP-based smart charging scenario, we identify security issues and threats and present solutions that have been proposed by scholars. We identify open security issues for OCPP and propose future research directions for the security enhancement of the protocol.},

	abstract = {As one of the most successful and effective software testing techniques in recent years, fuzz testing has uncovered numerous bugs and vulnerabilities in modern software, including network protocol software. In contrast to other fuzzing targets, network protocol software exhibits its distinct characteristics and challenges, introducing a plethora of research questions that need to be addressed in the design and implementation of network protocol fuzzers. While some research work has evaluated and systematized the knowledge of general fuzzing techniques at a high level, there is a lack of similar analysis and summarization for fuzzing research specific to network protocols. This paper offers a comprehensive exposition of network protocol softwareâs fuzzing-related features and conducts a systematic review of some representative advancements in network protocol fuzzing since its inception. We summarize state-of-the-art strategies and solutions in various aspects, propose a unified protocol fuzzing process model, and introduce the techniques involved in each stage of the model. At the same time, this paper also summarizes the promising research directions in the landscape of protocol fuzzing to foster exploration within the community for more efficient and intelligent modern network protocol fuzzing techniques.},

Therefore, network protocol security testing has become a hot area of research in network and information security. Popular vulnerability discovery techniques include static analysis, dynamic analysis, fuzzing and so on.

	abstract = {In recent years, security test of network protocols based on fuzzing has been attracting more and more attentions. This is very challenging compared with the stateless software fuzzing and most early network protocol fuzzers are of low speed and poor test effect. Since the first greybox and stateful fuzzer named AFLNET was proposed, several new schemes have been designed to improve its performance from different aspects. During the research, a great challenge is how to greatly improve the fuzzing efficiency. Based on the basic analysis in SNPSFuzzer, this paper provides a more thorough analysis about the time consumption in a fuzzing iteration for 13 network protocols and then we design a High-speed Network Protocol Fuzzer named HNPFuzzer. In HNPFuzzer, the test cases and response messages between the client and server are transmitted through the shared memory, guided by a precise synchronizer, rather than the socket interfaces. This greatly shorten the period of an iteration. Moreover, we design a persistent mode attempting to fuzz the service instances in the memory more than one time based on analyzing the side effect information. This mode further improves the speed of fuzzing. Experiment results illustrate that our scheme can improve the fuzzing throughput by about 39.66 times in average and triggers a large number of crashes including 2 new vulnerabilities which cannot discovered by existing fuzzers. Note that, the existing network protocol fuzzing schemes proposed in different directions do not compete with each other and on the contrary, they can collaborate with each other to improve the overall fuzzing effect and efficiency. Consequently, more existing tools can be integrated into our framework to get better network protocol fuzzing effect.},

	abstract = {Summary Fuzzing is an effective approach to detect software vulnerabilities utilizing changeable generated inputs. However, fuzzing the network protocol on the firmware of IoT devices is limited by inefficiency of test case generation, cross-architecture instrumentation, and fault detection. In this article, we propose the Fw-fuzz, a coverage-guided and crossplatform framework for fuzzing network services running in the context of firmware on embedded architectures, which can generate more valuable test cases by introspecting program runtime information and using a genetic algorithm model. Specifically, we propose novel dynamic instrumentation in Fw-fuzz to collect the running state of the firmware program. Then Fw-fuzz adopts a genetic algorithm model to guide the generation of inputs with high code coverage. We fully implement the prototype system of Fw-fuzz and conduct evaluations on network service programs of various architectures in MIPS, ARM, and PPC. By comparing with the protocol fuzzers Boofuzz and Peach in metrics of edge coverage, our prototype system achieves an average growth of 33.7\% and 38.4\%, respectively. We further verify six known vulnerabilities and discover 5 0-day vulnerabilities with the Fw-fuzz, which prove the validity and utility of our framework. The overhead of our system expressed as an additional 5\% of memory growth.},

	abstract = {Network protocols, as the communication rules among computer network devices, are the foundation for the normal operation of networks. However, security issues arising from design flaws and implementation vulnerabilities in network protocols pose significant risks to network operations and security. Network protocol fuzzing is an effective technique for discovering and mitigating security flaws in network protocols. It offers unparalleled advantages compared to other security analysis techniques thanks to the minimal requirement for prior knowledge of the target and low deployment complexity. Nevertheless, the randomness in test case generation, uncontrollable test coverage, and unstable testing efficiency introduce challenges in ensuring the controllability of the testing process and results. In order to comprehensively survey the development of network protocol fuzzing techniques and analyze their advantages and existing issues, in this paper, we categorized and summarized the protocol fuzzing and its related techniques based on the generation methods of test cases and testing conditions. Specifically, we overviewed the development trajectory and patterns of these techniques over the past two decades according to chronological order. Based on this analysis, we further predict the future directions of fuzzing techniques.},

	abstract = {Recent techniques have significantly improved fuzzing, discovering many vulnerabilities in various software systems. However, certain types of systems, such as network protocols, are still challenging to fuzz. This article presents two enhancements that allow efficient fuzzing of network protocols. The first is Desock+, which simulates a network socket and supports different POSIX options to make Desock+ suitable for faster network protocol fuzzing. The second is Green-Fuzz, which sends input messages in one go and reduces the system-call overhead while fuzzing network protocols. We applied this modification to AFLNet, but it could be applied to any fuzzer for stateful systems. This is the maximum overhead we can avoid, when doing out-process fuzzing on stateful systems. Our evaluation shows that these enhancements make AFLNet up to four times faster.},
